## Collaborative and Service Robotics Lab @ LINKS Foundation
### Who we are

The Collaborative and Service Robotics Lab is a laboratory dedicated to **research, develop and test innovative technological solutions** regarding Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence and Edge Computing, all integrated with robotic systems to enhance their ability to move, act and cooperate autonomously in dynamic scenarios.
The goal is to **improve the autonomy for current robotic technology** in various application scenarios (Factory of the Future, Smart Cities, Indoor Logistics). In this context the laboratory offers hardware and software tools to study, design, develop and test prototype solutions for:

* **service robotics**;
* **collaboration and physical interaction between man and robot**;
* **cooperative intelligence** distributed in Cyber-Physical System of Systems (CPSoS) scenarios.
The laboratory is responsible for approaches that aim to avoid obstacles in dynamic scenarios, for autonomous and adaptive planning of paths and tasks and for multimodal interaction between robots, man and the surrounding environment. Among other enabling technology the laboratory uses **precise indoor location solutions** based on wireless UWB technology, on which the Foundation has strong competence in funded and industrial projects.

The laboratory has robotic equipment such as **drones, mobile land robots** and small manipulators for implementation and validation of developed applications. The laboratory offers infrastructures for the realisation of physical and virtual tests too:

* an area within a 7Ã—3 metres **cage** with a UWB-based precise location system **for drone tests**;
* a **scaling software environment** fit for modelling and simulation of **multi-robot applications and algorithms**.
The laboratory performs a showcase function for solutions implemented in many application fields in funded and industrial projects (demonstrators for specific use cases or technology) that can in that way be evaluated by different stakeholders (businesses, universities and research centres, students) to stimulate new ideas and promote future innovation opportunities in society and industry.
